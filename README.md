# coffee_sales_dashboard_using_excel
### Project Overview
This project is a coffee sales dashboard created in Excel. The dashboard visualizes sales data over several years, allowing users to easily analyze sales trends and identify top customers. It includes data transformations and visualizations to provide insights into monthly and quarterly sales, customer segmentation, and product popularity.

### Steps Taken

**Data Preparation:**
- Data Aggregation: Combined and cleaned data from multiple tables (e.g., Orders, Customers, Products) to create a unified dataset.
- Data Lookup: Used XLOOKUP and INDEX & MATCH functions to retrieve missing order data from other sheets, ensuring completeness.
- Data Cleaning: Standardized entries for readability, such as changing roast types from codes (e.g., "M" to "Medium," "L" to "Light") to descriptive terms.

**Data Analysis:**
- Pivot Tables: Created pivot tables to derive specific measures such as total sales by year, month, and quarter, as well as to track customer purchase patterns.

### Dashboard Creation:

- Organized visual summaries of key metrics, displaying coffee sales trends over years, broken down by months and quarters.
- Identified the highest-spending customers, which can help in targeted marketing efforts.
- Regional Sales Analysis: A dedicated section on sales by country shows how different regions perform.
- Interactive Filtering: Slicers are added for key filters such as year, customer segments, product type, or country. This allows users to dynamically interact with the dashboard and drill down into specific data segments to gain more targeted insights.

### Insights from the Dashboard
